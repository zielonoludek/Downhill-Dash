##  Downhill Dash is a thrilling, physics-based 3D downhill longboarding racing game designed for mobile devices.

The game features two unique levels each lasting between one and two minutes, with a variety of twists, turns, and obstacles to test your mettle! Choose between Colombia or Norway.

Play in Solo Mode to race alone and try to set the best time possible. Play in Versus Mode to take turns racing with a friend. Player 1 will race as normal and then Player 2 will try to beat Player 1’s time, even seeing a ‘ghost’ of Player 1 during their run.

Use swipe controls or mouse/keyboard to control the skateboarder. Swiping/pressing Down will cause the player to crouch, increasing speed but making handling tougher. Swiping/pressing Up will return the player to a standing position and reduce the speed and increase handling. To steer the player, just swipe/press and hold left or right.

The game also features a Customisation screen, allowing you to rotate between three different outfits, and three different board designs.
